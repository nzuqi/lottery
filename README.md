# lottery
A JavaScript program that generates three random numbers, allows the user to guess the three numbers, compares each of the user's guesses, and awards the user on the correctly guessed numbers.

## [Question](https://github.com/nzuqi/lottery/blob/main/Java%20script%20simple%20program.pdf)
Create a program named lottery.html that generates three random numbers, each between 1 and 10 inclusive. Allow the user to guess three numbers. Compare each of the user’s guesses
to the three random numbers and display a message that includes the user’s guess, the three randomly determined numbers, and the amount of money the user has won, based on the
information in the bulleted list below. Ensure the application accommodates repeating digits.
For example, if a user guesses 1, 2, and 3 and the randomly generated digits are 1, 1, and 1, do not give the user credit for three correct guesses – just one

* One match - $100
* Two matches - $200
* Three matches - $500
* No matches - $0

When the game is over, ask the user if they’d like to play again (user should be able to enter a Y or y or N or n) HINT: If one of the user’s numbers and one of the random numbers are a match, how can you ‘flag’ them to make sure they aren’t used again? Boolean variables! Go back and check out the Learning Plan 6 Lecture Video and go to the 16:00 mark where I start talking about Booleans and have a few examples (a really good example at the 21:00 mark).
Watch [this video](https://youtu.be/TgJX3I9cwNc) explaining how the application should function.
